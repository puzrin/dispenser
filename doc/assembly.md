## Required components

&nbsp; | Name | Comment
-----|-------------|--------
1 | [PCB & Components](https://easyeda.com/speed/AC-speed-control-for-grinder) | Go to EasyEda project page and order both in couple of clicks. If you order PCB first, components second, then you will be able to join delivery and save some bucks.
2 | [0.96" IPS Display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32861823719.html) |
3 | [Micro stepper motor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32979960185.html) | Other motors will need rework of 3d-printed supports.
4 | [Gearbox 1:300+ with long shaft](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32987637967.html) | For max gear ratio select lowest speed.
5 | [Transparent heat shrink tube 20-22 mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32791427710.html) | Display mount
6 | [2-side soft scotch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33042643312.html) | Display mount
6 | [22 AWG wire](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854919883.html) | SMT stencil positioning & motor mount.
7 | [Heat shrink tube 40 mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32791427710.html) | Motor mount

Note. You are strongly advised to order SMT stencil for your PCB. That will
add ~ 8$ in total to your order - good price for convenience. On placing stencil
order at jlcpcb, select option "custom size", and define small one. Then stencil
will be compact and light, with small delivery cost.
